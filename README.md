# Learn Go With Tests

This repository is my journey through the fantastic free book ["Learn Go With Tests"](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/). This guide is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn Go programming language using a test-driven development approach.

Each chapter of the book corresponds to a separate package in this repository.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install it.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone git@github.com:isavita/learn-go-with-testing.git`.
3. Navigate to the desired package (which represents a chapter of the book) using the command `cd {package_name}`. For example, to navigate to the `property_based` package, you would enter `cd property_based`.
4. Once inside the desired package, you can run the tests using the command `go test`.
5. If you want to run the benchmarks, you can use the command `go test -bench=.`.
